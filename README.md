### Mano is a small windows app that let you switch the left and right mouse buttons easily.

Especially intended for that **left-handed** people who share computers with non-left-handed people :smirk:

Just download the app and place it on your desktop. The next time you need to share your computer with a clumsy right-handed human being, open the app and choose the hand you want to use!

**Don't understand the purpose of this app?** That's because you are probably right-handed (or one of those lefties that still use the mouse with the ~~right~~ wrong hand :-1:)
